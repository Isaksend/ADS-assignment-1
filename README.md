# Java Utility Application

This Java utility application provides a suite of mathematical and utility functions through a simple console interface. Users can perform tasks such as finding minimum values in an array, calculating averages, checking prime numbers, calculating factorials, finding Fibonacci numbers, calculating powers, checking digits, calculating binomial coefficients, and finding the greatest common divisor (GCD).

## Features

- **Find Minimum**: Find the minimum value in an array of integers.
- **Calculate Average**: Calculate the average of an array of integers.
- **Prime Check**: Determine if a given number is prime.
- **Factorial Calculation**: Calculate the factorial of a given number.
- **Fibonacci Number Finder**: Find the Fibonacci number at the specified position in the sequence.
- **Power Calculation**: Calculate the power of a given base to a given exponent.
- **Digit Check**: Check if the given input is a full digit.
- **Binomial Coefficient**: Calculate the binomial coefficient for given values of n and k.
- **Greatest Common Divisor**: Find the GCD of two numbers.
- **Print Reversed**: Print elements in reverse order from input.

## Getting Started

To use this application, you will need Java installed on your machine.

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Compile the `Main.java` file using your preferred Java compiler or development environment.
3. Run the compiled `Main.class` file.
4. Choose the task for testing
5. Input the needly data
6. Get the result

## Usage

After starting the application, follow the on-screen prompts to select and perform tasks:

1. Choose the task you wish to perform by entering the corresponding number when prompted.
2. Follow the specific instructions for each task. For tasks requiring input arrays, you will first be asked for the number of elements and then the elements themselves.
3. View the output directly in the console.

### Example

```plaintext
Choose task for check: 3
Input the number for check 'Is Prime?'
7
7 is a Prime number
